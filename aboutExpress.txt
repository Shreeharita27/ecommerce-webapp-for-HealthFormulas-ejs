ExpressJS is a free and open-source backend web app framework for Node.js, designed to allow developers to build single-page, 
multi-page, and hybrid web apps and APIs using JavaScript.

Essentially, it is a layer built on top of Node.JS that helps manage routes, middleware, template engines, and static file servers.
It is minimalistic, unopinionated, and powerful, ensuring that the radical I/O performance of Node is not compromised.

Express is mainly suitable for highly interactive web projects as it allows developers to build quicker and scalable web apps easily.

If you are going to develop a large project that will be supported by a large team of developers, the lack of standardization 
can be a bottleneck in the productivity of your teams.
